Evgen: Virtual Evolution Simulator
Evgen is a simulation project designed to explore the concept of evolution in a digital ecosystem. 
Using a graph-based digital DNA system, Evgen models how traits and intelligence could emerge over time in a lifelike environment. 
The project aims to simulate virtual organisms evolving based on natural selection, genetic mutations, and survival mechanisms.
